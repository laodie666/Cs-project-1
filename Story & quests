Intro:

You have just returned from your visit to your grandparents at Markham and have now arrived in Toronto again for your test tomorrow. When you arrive at your dorm, 
you suddenly realize you don't have your T-card. You start to panic and think about things you are missing. You realize you forgot to take your grandma's lucky pen 
for good luck on the exam, and you have also yet to make a cheat sheet.

You contemplate your options and decide to bus back to Markham again. Your mom at home probably still has the T-card that she asked you to give her so she can show

the cheat sheet.
