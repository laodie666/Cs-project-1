Note when writing game prompt: put **insert text** around important info such as location and item. 

Intro:

You have just returned from your visit to your grandparents at Markham and have now arrived in Toronto again for your test tomorrow. When you arrive at your dorm, you suddenly realize you don't have your T-card. You start to panic and think about things you are missing. You realize you forgot to take your grandma's lucky pen for good luck on the exam, and you have also yet to make a cheat sheet.

[insert player input]

You contemplate your options and decide to bus back to Markham again. Your mom at home probably still has the T-card that she asked you to give her so she can show off to her friends about how her child got into UofT. You can also get the lucky pen from your grandma, and visit your super smart friend to study together and make the cheat sheet. 

Game begins:

[Ok so this is mainly where the game's mechanics are going to be implemented via locations and interaction. I'm just gonna go over the overall progression of the game]

[insert basic introduction to the various inputs the players can do and how they should use them, for example: "type in look and press enter after arriving at a new location to obtain the detailed description of the location, and see whether it is interactable. "]

The player begins at the dorm and has to move to the Downtown Go Bus Station. 

The player goes to the Downtown Go Bus Station by using the method and then interacts to get on the Go Bus and go back to Markham. This serves as a tutorial so the player gets a hang of how to use the commands before starting quests. 


Quests (Markham):

Implementation note: For each quest line, there would be a boolean value storing whether the quest is active or not. Locations will behave differently according to whether the quest is active or not. For example: the Mother's friend's house would be not interactable if the T-card quest isn't active, but if it is, another line of the prompt will be output when looking "Your mother should be in there", and now you can interact with it by knocking the door. 


The player is now at Markham and is free to do what they wish to do. They are prompted that they can now go wherever, and if they are done with whatever they want to do, they can interact at the Markham Go Bus Station to go back to Toronto and rest for sleep. See more in Game Endings. 


T-card quest:

You will have to go to your parent's house. Realize no one is home. If you look, you will see a calendar with your mother's friend's birthday marked on it. It is prompted that your mom is probably at her friend's place. It is also prompted the T-card quest is now active.
