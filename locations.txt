You are at your residence, New University College. This is a new U of T residence 
although your room is a bit messy after digging around for your t-card, you couldnâ€™t be 
happier with all the space especially since you were able to get a single room. You have 
room for your bed and a desk. The location is very convenient since Union Station is just 
north of here.
