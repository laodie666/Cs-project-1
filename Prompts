You're back at your dorm at U of T, your visit back home to Markham to see your grandparents is over. 
Back to the school mindset. What did you have to do again? 
OH RIGHT! You have an exam tomorrow, but wait...
Where is your T-card, you need that to get in. 
And you didn't study so you have no cheat sheet.
And where is your lucky pen? 
Okay so where to start:
Your mom took your T-card because her friend wouldn't believe you got into U of T while you were in Markham.
You can make a cheat sheet with your friend Eric back in Markham.
And you were studying at your grandparents so your pen must be there.
Time gather the items!
